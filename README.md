An advanced production clock inspired and changed from this repository: https://github.com/lebaston100/ProductionClock

Hey! Do you need a clock? I know you do. I am creating a production clock from another repository (https://github.com/lebaston100/ProductionClock) and basicly copying the code and adding a few lines. However it looks nice. If you dont want a complex production clock and just want an actual simple working clock, just go to the orignal creation that I have linked above. I have tested it and it does work and looks great and has a simple and well-documented setup. My version will have some extra steps but not too hard.
(Please just read the setup guide from the original repository)
